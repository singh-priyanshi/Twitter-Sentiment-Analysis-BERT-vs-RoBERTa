# Twitter Sentiment Analysis: BERT vs RoBERTa

This repository contains the implementation and comparative analysis of two state-of-the-art transformer models, **BERT** and **RoBERTa**, for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The goal of this project is to determine which model performs better in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency for classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a key task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves classifying text into various sentiment categories. In this project, we explore the use of two widely used models for this task:

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
- **RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)**

Both models are pre-trained transformer models and have set new benchmarks in many NLP tasks. The aim of this project is to evaluate their performance on a sentiment analysis task using a Twitter dataset.

## Model Architecture

### BERT

BERT is a transformer-based model that uses a bidirectional training approach. It is pre-trained on large corpora and fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, like sentiment analysis. The model utilizes a multi-layer attention mechanism that allows it to capture complex patterns in text by understanding the context of a word from both directions.

Key Features:
- **Bidirectional training**: Allows the model to learn the context of words from both sides.
- **Attention mechanism**: Focuses on important parts of a sentence during training.
- **Pre-training on large datasets**: BERT is pre-trained on the BookCorpus and Wikipedia datasets.

### RoBERTa

RoBERTa is an improved version of BERT, with enhanced training strategies, including:
- **Longer sequences**: RoBERTa processes larger batches with longer sequences.
- **Larger mini-batches**: Leading to more stable training.
- **Dynamic masking**: Unlike BERT, RoBERTa uses dynamic masking for better generalization during pre-training.

RoBERTa has shown better results than BERT in several NLP tasks, thanks to its robust training procedures.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of a collection of tweets that are labeled with their corresponding sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral. This dataset is well-suited for sentiment analysis tasks and has been preprocessed to remove noise like stop words, special characters, and URLs.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning the tweets (removal of URLs, punctuation, etc.).
   - Tokenizing the text using the tokenizers provided by Hugging Face for both BERT and RoBERTa.
   
2. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - Both BERT and RoBERTa are fine-tuned on the sentiment analysis dataset using the `Transformers` library from Hugging Face.
   - The models are trained using a classification head that takes the output of the transformers and predicts the sentiment.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are tuned to improve model performance.
   
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - F1-Score
   - Precision and Recall

## Results

Both BERT and RoBERTa performed exceptionally well on the classification task, with F1-scores around 90%. However, there were notable differences in their performance:

- **BERT** achieved an accuracy of around 89% but required more computational resources during training.
- **RoBERTa** slightly outperformed BERT with a 90% accuracy and faster training times.

## Conclusion

The comparative analysis showed that while both models are highly effective for sentiment analysis, **RoBERTa** performed better in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. It is recommended for scenarios where computational resources are limited.
